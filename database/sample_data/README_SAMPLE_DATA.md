## Data Verification

After loading sample data, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check educational content
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_content FROM patient_education_content WHERE created_by = 'Dr. Admin';
-- Expected: 9

-- Check surgery options
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_options FROM surgery_options;
-- Expected: 7 (includes 2 from MASTER_CORE_SETUP.sql)

-- Check sample patients
SELECT COUNT(*) as sample_patients FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%';
-- Expected: 5

-- Check decision journeys
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_journeys FROM patient_decision_journey;
-- Expected: 5

-- View patients needing attention (low engagement or overdue)
SELECT
    p.name,
    pdj.current_stage,
    pdj.engagement_score,
    pdj.decision_deadline,
    pdj.last_contact_date
FROM patient_decision_journey pdj
JOIN patients p ON pdj.patient_id = p.id
WHERE pdj.engagement_score < 50 OR pdj.decision_deadline < CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY pdj.engagement_score ASC;
```

## Important Notes

### Patient Phone Numbers
All phone numbers are dummy numbers:
- Format: +91987654321X
- These are for testing only
- WhatsApp messages won't actually be sent to these numbers
- Use real patient data in production

### Realistic Timestamps
All sample data uses **relative timestamps**:
- Consultations: 5-20 days ago
- Last contacts: 1-8 days ago
- Content sent: Throughout patient journey
- This makes data feel current even if loaded weeks later

### Engagement Scores
Calculated realistically based on:
- Content sent vs viewed ratio
- Response to calls
- WhatsApp message read status
- Time since last contact

### Data Isolation
Sample patients have IDs starting with `PT-2025-` so you can easily:
- Identify test data
- Delete test data if needed
- Keep separate from real patients

---

## Cleaning Up Sample Data

If you want to remove all sample data:

```sql
-- Delete sample patients and related data
DELETE FROM patient_decision_journey WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%'
);

DELETE FROM whatsapp_automation_log WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%'
);

DELETE FROM voice_call_logs WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%'
);

DELETE FROM patient_education_tracking WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%'
);

DELETE FROM visits WHERE visit_id LIKE 'VST-2025-%';
DELETE FROM patients WHERE patients_id LIKE 'PT-2025-%';

-- Delete sample educational content
DELETE FROM patient_education_content WHERE created_by = 'Dr. Admin';

-- Note: This keeps existing surgery options as they might be useful
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Foreign key violation"
**Cause:** MASTER_CORE_SETUP.sql not run yet
**Solution:** Run MASTER_CORE_SETUP.sql first, then run sample data

### Issue: "Unique violation"
**Cause:** Sample data already loaded
**Solution:** Data is already there! Check the dashboard or clean up first

### Issue: No patients showing in Follow-Up Dashboard
**Cause:** Patients might be in completed/declined stages
**Solution:** Sample data creates patients in active stages (initial_consultation, education_phase, options_review, decision_making)

### Issue: Can't see educational content
**Cause:** Content might be marked as inactive
**Solution:** All sample content is marked `is_active = true`
